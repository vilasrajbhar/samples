Hey Team,

As you already know, today is my last day in CG and here's wishing you all Good bye for now. 

While I’m excited about the new opportunity, there’s also a big part of me that’s sad to be saying goodbye to amazing co-workers just like you. I can’t tell you how much I’ve enjoyed our time working together and learning from you all and how much I value the team spirit you’ve shown me over the past couple of months.

This might be the end of my time in this organisation, But, it’s definitely not the end of our friendship. You have my number—so don’t hesitate to reach out whenever you feel like. 

It’s been great working together, and I’ll definitely keep in touch! Hope our paths cross again.

All the best to all of you for your endeavours.
